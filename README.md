AK Ice Creams is a Django-powered web application that provides a responsive frontend using Bootstrap 5 and a backend powered by Django's model-view-template architecture. It features dynamic page routing, a contact form with CSRF protection, form validation, and success messages using Django’s messaging framework. Submitted form data is saved into a SQLite database via a Contact model and can be managed through the Django admin interface. The project also includes a working search bar in the navbar that filters contact submissions based on name using Django’s ORM with icontains. Static files like CSS and images are handled via Django’s static files system using {% load static %} in templates. The app follows clean project structure, uses modular views, and integrates Bootstrap components for UI consistency. To run locally, set up a virtual environment, install dependencies, run migrations, and start the development server using python manage.py runserver. Ideal for learning Django fundamentals including routing, models, form handling, template rendering, and search logic.
